# Setting Up a Web Application Firewall (WAF) on AWS

This project focuses on setting up a Web Application Firewall (WAF) on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to enhance the security posture of web applications. By deploying a WAF, users can protect their web applications from common security threats, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

This project demonstrates the process of setting up and configuring a WAF on AWS, leveraging AWS WAF, a highly scalable and customizable firewall service designed to protect web applications hosted on AWS.

- _AWS WAF Setup_:  set up and configure AWS WAF in their AWS account. AWS WAF provides a range of features and functionalities to protect web applications against common web exploits and vulnerabilities.

- _Rule Configuration_: configure WAF rules based on the specific security requirements of their web applications. These rules can include conditions and actions to block or allow requests based on various criteria, such as IP addresses, HTTP headers, or request parameters.

**Benefits of WAF**

- _Customization_: Users can customize WAF rules and policies to align with the specific security requirements and compliance standards of their web applications.
- _Centralized Management_: AWS WAF provides centralized management and control, allowing users to configure, monitor, and update security policies across multiple web applications from a single dashboard.
